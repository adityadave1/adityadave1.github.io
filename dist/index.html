            <img src="/assets/frontalLobe-BiGGsyDk.jpeg" alt="Frontal Lobe MRI" class="lobe-img">
            <p>The <strong>Frontal Lobe</strong> is the largest of the four major lobes of the mammalian cerebral
                cortex. Situated at the front of each cerebral hemisphere, it is responsible for higher-level cognitive
                functions, including decision-making, executive control, problem-solving, planning, and voluntary
                movement.</p>
            <p>It houses the <strong>Primary Motor Cortex (M1)</strong> along the precentral gyrus, which initiates
                voluntary movements by sending signals down the corticospinal tract. Additionally, the dominant
                hemisphere (typically the left) contains <strong>Broca's area</strong>, a region essential for the
                orchestration of speech production and language articulation.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-category="parietal-info">
            <img src="/assets/parietalLobe-DMKvWPkn.jpeg" alt="Parietal Lobe MRI" class="lobe-img">
            <p>The <strong>Parietal Lobe</strong> is positioned above the temporal lobe and behind the frontal lobe. It
                functions as a critical hub for integrating sensory information from various modalities, particularly
                determining spatial sense and navigation (proprioception).</p>
            <p>Along the postcentral gyrus lies the <strong>Primary Somatosensory Cortex (S1)</strong>, mapped as a
                sensory homunculus, which processes cutaneous sensations such as touch, temperature, and pain. The
                posterior parietal cortex heavily integrates visual inputs with proprioception to guide movements and
                maintain a coherent representation of the body in space.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-category="occipital-info">
            <img src="/assets/occ-CvCyclW5.jpeg" alt="Occipital Lobe MRI" class="lobe-img">
            <p>The <strong>Occipital Lobe</strong> is the visual processing center of the mammalian brain containing
                most of the anatomical region of the visual cortex. Located at the very back of the skull, it receives
                heavily processed afferent signals from the retinas via the optic tracts and lateral geniculate nucleus
                (LGN).</p>
            <p>It contains the <strong>Primary Visual Cortex (V1)</strong> in the calcarine fissure, mapping visual
                space retinotopically. From V1, information diverges into the dorsal "where" stream (for spatial
                location and action) toward the parietal lobe, and the ventral "what" stream (for object recognition and
                form) toward the temporal lobe.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-category="temporal-info">
            <img src="/assets/temporal-C2yZB44s.png" alt="Temporal Lobe MRI" class="lobe-img">
            <p>The <strong>Temporal Lobe</strong> is situated laterally, beneath the lateral fissure on both cerebral
                hemispheres. It is deeply involved in processing sensory input into derived meanings for the appropriate
                retention of visual memory, language comprehension, and emotion association.</p>
            <p>It houses the <strong>Primary Auditory Cortex</strong> for interpreting sounds at specific frequencies
                (tonotopic mapping). In the dominant hemisphere, it contains <strong>Wernicke's Area</strong>, crucial
                for language comprehension. Deep medially, the temporal lobe encompasses the limbic system structures,
                most notably the <strong>hippocampus</strong> (declarative memory formation) and the
                <strong>amygdala</strong> (emotional processing and fear modulation).
            </p>

        <div data-category="cerebellum-info">
            <img src="/assets/cerebellum-DOIDXJp9.jpeg" alt="Cerebellum MRI" class="lobe-img">
            <p>The <strong>Cerebellum</strong> ("little brain") sits at the posterior base of the brain, just above the
                brainstem. While it contains over 50% of the brain's total neurons, it does not initiate movement;
                rather, it intricately fine-tunes motor commands from the cerebrum for fluid, balanced, and precise
                voluntary motion.</p>
            <p>It analyzes proprioceptive feedback from the spinocerebellar tracts and compares it with intended motor
                commands continuously to resolve "motor error." The cerebellum is heavily involved in <strong>motor
                    learning</strong>, classical conditioning, procedural memory formation, and maintaining posture and
                equilibrium via the vestibular system.</p>

                <p>Experiencing One Winter Night was profound. Spending a night outside in the cold to understand the
                    struggles of homelessness was a humbling reminder of the fragility of human comfort. This year, I
                    hope to lead our efforts and get involved with C-U at Home.</p>
