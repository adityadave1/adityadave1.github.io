                <img src="images/parietalLobe.jpeg" alt="Parietal Lobe">
  <p>The parietal lobe is a crucial region of the brain located behind the central sulcus and above the temporal lobe. It plays a pivotal role in processing sensory information, understanding spatial relationships, and navigating the environment.</p>

  <h3>Key Functions of the Parietal Lobe:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sensory Integration:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Somatosensation:</strong> The parietal lobe receives and processes sensory information from the body, including touch, temperature, pain, and proprioception (the sense of body position).</li>
        <li><strong>Nociception:</strong> It plays a crucial role in perceiving and responding to pain.</li>
        <li><strong>Tactile perception:</strong> The parietal lobe helps us recognize objects by touch and discriminate between different textures.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Spatial Awareness:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Spatial attention:</strong> It helps us focus our attention on specific locations in space.</li>
        <li><strong>Spatial working memory:</strong> It allows us to hold and manipulate spatial information in our minds.</li>
        <li><strong>Visual-spatial processing:</strong> The parietal lobe is involved in interpreting visual information related to space, such as depth perception, distance estimation, and object location.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Number Processing:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Numerosity:</strong> It contributes to our ability to represent and manipulate numbers.</li>
        <li><strong>Calculation:</strong> The parietal lobe is involved in performing mathematical operations.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Body Representation:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Body schema:</strong> It creates and maintains a mental representation of our own bodies.</li>
        <li><strong>Motor planning:</strong> The parietal lobe contributes to planning and executing movements.</li>

                <p id="modalDescription2">Experiencing One Winter Night was a profoundly impactful experience for me. At an event focused on spending a night outside in the cold and facing the harsh elements to better understand the struggles of homelessness, my parietal lobe was firing on all ends, reacting to the harsh conditions. It was a humbling reminder of the fragility of human comfort and a call to action to use my privilege to help others.</p>

                <p>Working as a triage volunteer at the Champaign County Christian Health Center (CCHCH) has been a deeply rewarding experience. I've had the privilege of witnessing firsthand the positive impact that accessible healthcare can have on people's lives.</p>

                <p>As a triage volunteer, I've been able to play a crucial role in ensuring that patients receive the care they need, when they need it. From greeting patients at the door to directing them to the appropriate medical providers, I've been able to make a tangible difference in their experience.</p>

                <p>One of the most rewarding aspects of my time at CCHCH has been the opportunity to connect with patients on a personal level. I've listened to their stories, offered support, and helped alleviate their anxieties. It's been incredibly fulfilling to know that I've played a small part in helping patients feel better and regain their health.</p>

                <p>My experiences at CCHCH have not only strengthened my clinical skills but have also deepened my empathy and compassion. I've learned the importance of treating every patient with respect and dignity, regardless of their circumstances.</p>

                <p>I'm truly grateful for the opportunity to serve my community as a triage volunteer at CCHCH. It's been a life-changing experience that has shaped me both personally and professionally.</p>

                <p >Playing the cello for nine years has been a truly enriching experience. Music has always been a passion of mine, and the cello has provided me with a unique outlet for expression and creativity.</p>

                <p>This year, I founded the Film Score Orchestra (FSO). Inspired by my love of film music, I recognized a need for more non-classical focused ensembles on campus. I wanted to create a space where students could come together to explore and perform the music they love.</p>

I'm super happy to have a great team with fellow Stamps Scholars Julia, Grayson, and Sofia!</p>

                <p>We're currently hard at work preparing for our first concert, which is just two weeks away. It's been a challenging but rewarding process, and I'm excited to share our music with the campus community.</p>

                <h2>The Power of Visualizations and Graphics</h2>

  <p>As an undergraduate researcher working on <strong>LC-MS analytical chemistry in a NASA partnered project, summer research at the National Institute of Theory and Mathematics in Biology, and NIH data analysis</strong>, I've found that the ability to interpret graphs, charts, and visual data is crucial to understanding and success. The occipital lobe, responsible for visual processing, plays a significant role in this ability.</p>

  <p>The occipital lobe's role in processing visual inputs is essential for analyzing complex datasets like those found in LCMS. By accurately interpreting visual representations of data, I can identify patterns, trends, and anomalies that might otherwise be missed.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the occipital lobe's involvement in visual processing is crucial for visualizing patterns in NIH data analysis. By effectively interpreting visual data, I can gain valuable insights into research findings and make informed conclusions.</p>

  <p>I had the privilege of observing two surgeries: a Pleomorphic Xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) resection and a brain biopsy. The operating room was a bustling environment, with a team of highly skilled professionals working together seamlessly. It was fascinating to see how each member of the team played a crucial role in ensuring the success of the surgery.</p>

  <p>One of the most memorable moments was seeing the human brain exposed. It was a surreal experience to observe the complex anatomy and delicate structures of this vital organ that I have been learning about in class. Although surgeon's precision and skill were truly remarkable, I was struck by the true integration of imaging technology in the operating room, which significantly enhanced the precision and efficiency of the surgeries.</p>

  <p>In addition to the operating room experience, I also had the opportunity to shadow the neurosurgeon in clinic. This provided me with valuable insights into the importance of developing long-term relationships with patients. I learned about the intricacies of academic medicine, including research, teaching, and patient care.</p>

  <p>Overall, shadowing a neurosurgeon was an incredibly enriching experience. It has deepened my understanding of the medical field and reinforced my passion for pursuing a career in healthcare.</p>
